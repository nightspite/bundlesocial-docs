## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  { 
    "ApiKeyAuth": [] 
  }
]
```

To authorize with the API, you need to provide an API key in the `x-api-key` header.
```json
{
  "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
}
```
