title: How I’ve managed my burnout
---

Life’s incessant demands—whether personal challenges, intense work projects, or rigorous academic pursuits—can lead us to the brink of burnout. It's a state marked by emotional exhaustion, reduced accomplishment, and depersonalization. For me, the journey into burnout was gradual, unnoticed at first, then painfully evident. My story reflects a common struggle and, more importantly, a pathway to recovery and resilience.

<h2>The Descent into Burnout</h2>

It began in 2022, amid the backdrop of a family health crisis. My father, diagnosed with a terminal lung disorder, was battling for his life in the ICU and needed a double lung transplant. The emotional toll of flying between San Francisco and Bangalore, balancing work, and managing family decisions was overwhelming. My father’s eventual passing on my 30th birthday, followed shortly by the loss of my grandfather, plunged me into deep grief. This period was my first real confrontation with mortality, which profoundly altered my perspective on life and work.

In the aftermath, I returned to a 'normal' that no longer felt familiar. Eager to regain control, I accepted my first managerial role. This new responsibility, though a professional advancement, quickly became a source of immense pressure. I stretched myself thin across time zones and tasks, ignoring the signs of my fraying mental and physical health until a collapse at my desk forced a reckoning.

<h2>Acknowledging and Addressing Burnout</h2>

The road to recovery began with acknowledgment. I had to face the reality of my burnout head-on—recognizing it as a legitimate issue that required attention and care. I learned to set boundaries and declined projects that would stretch me too thin. This period involved deep introspection about what truly brought me joy and fulfillment, both professionally and personally.

<h2>Strategies for Rebuilding Resilience</h2>

Ultimately, I chose to leave the high-pressure environment of management consulting. This decision was driven by the need for a more balanced lifestyle that could accommodate my renewed priorities.

<h2>Lessons Learned and Future Directions</h2>

The journey back from burnout taught me the indispensable value of self-care and the power of vulnerability. It highlighted the importance of resilience—not just the ability to endure but to adapt and thrive. As I navigated my recovery, I discovered strength in transparency, sharing my struggles with colleagues and friends, which, in turn, fostered a supportive community.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Today, I look back on that period of burnout not just as a challenging chapter but as a transformative one. It reshaped my understanding of success, productivity, and health. To those feeling the weight of similar challenges, remember: it's okay to step back, to reassess, and to rebuild differently. Resilience isn't about bouncing back to where you were before; it's about moving forward with new wisdom and strength. Always prioritize your well-being—your future self will thank you for it.
