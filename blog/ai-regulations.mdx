title: Why itâ€™s difficult to regulate AI
---

The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence technologies, which can create highly convincing yet entirely fabricated texts and images, has sparked significant concerns about the potential for increased fraud and misinformation. This technological capability, accessible to millions without technical expertise, necessitates a careful examination of regulatory measures to mitigate associated risks.

<h2>The Challenge of Regulating AI</h2>

Regulating AI effectively is complex due to the technology's ever-evolving nature. Policymakers struggle to keep pace with the advancements in AI, making it difficult to establish laws that adequately address the current and future implications of these technologies.

Human Foibles and a Moving Target

S. Shyam Sundar, a professor at Penn State, highlights that the need for regulation stems not just from the capabilities of AI but from human psychology. People tend to overestimate AI's capabilities and trust these systems too readily, which can lead to overreliance and misuse. AI's evolving nature means that it can behave unpredictably, necessitating mechanisms in place for accountability and recourse when things go wrong.

<h2>Combining 'Soft' and 'Hard' Approaches</h2>

Cason Schmit, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University, points out the difficulties in defining AI legally and understanding its risks and benefits. He suggests a hybrid regulatory approach that includes 'soft laws' set by private organizations, which can adapt more quickly than traditional legislative processes. Schmit also introduces an innovative model combining copyleft licensing and trusted enforcement to ensure compliance with ethical standards in AI usage.

<h2>The Necessity for a Nuanced Dialogue</h2>

John Villasenor of UCLA underscores the importance of framing any AI-specific regulation around key questions to ensure that laws are effective without stifling innovation. These include evaluating the necessity of new regulations, considering the risks of regulating based on a technological snapshot, understanding potential unintended consequences, and acknowledging economic and geopolitical implications.

<h2>The Path Forward</h2>

The advent of AI technologies like DALL-E, Midjourney, and GPT-4, among others, has democratized access to powerful tools capable of generating realistic content, which can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes. This dual-use nature of AI technologies presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities.

The discussions by experts underline the critical need for a balanced approach to AI regulation that incorporates flexibility, foresight, and a deep understanding of both technology and human behavior. Regulatory frameworks must be dynamic and adaptable, capable of evolving with the technologies they aim to govern. Moreover, fostering an environment where ethical considerations are at the forefront of AI development and deployment is essential.

As AI technologies continue to advance and permeate more aspects of everyday life, the dialogue between technologists, policymakers, and the public becomes increasingly important. Ensuring that AI developments benefit society while minimizing harms requires collaborative efforts, innovative regulatory approaches, and ongoing vigilance. The goal is not just to manage AI but to steer its development in ways that enhance societal welfare and safeguard against its potential misuses.
